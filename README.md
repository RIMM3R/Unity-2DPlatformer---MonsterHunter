# Unity-2DPlatformer---MonsterHunter
2D platformer built upon a tutorial I followed. Inspired by my love of Spleunky and The Witcher, it uses a similar control scheme to Spelunky with the intention of upgrading yourself with mutations harvested off fallen monsters. So far I have been concentrating on ensuring the player character is fun to control while working on some enemy types.
